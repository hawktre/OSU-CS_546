We'll obtain the interaction data from the Pathway Commons SIF file (in the `shared/` folder), we'll make an \"adjacency forest\" representation of the network, and we'll manually compute the local clustering coefficient of each vertex (protein) in the network using the \"enumerating neighbor pairs\" method described by Newman. Then we'll run the same algorithm using the `transitivity_local_undirected` function in `igraph`, and we'll compare the results in order to check our work.  Grad students:  you should also group vertices by their \"binned\" vertex degree k (bin size 50, total number of bins = 25) and plot the average local clustering coefficient for the vertices within a bin, against the center k value for the bin, on log-log scale (compare to Newman Fig. 8.12)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d_8aAOyd5dpA"},"source":["For this notebook, we will need cairo, igraph, pandas, numpy, timeit, pympler.asizeof, bintrees, and matplotlib.

You'll probably want to have an outer `for` loop for vertex ID `n` going from 0 to 99, and then an inner `for` loop iterating over neighbor vertices of vertex `n`. Store the clustering coefficients in a list `civals`. Print out how many seconds it takes to perform this calculation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":216},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":100113,"status":"error","timestamp":1768440680196,"user":{"displayName":"Trent VanHawkins","userId":"03240593052724796268"},"user_tz":480},"id":"x2uB51078-AC","outputId":"f13e1076-10aa-412e-822d-9d9b4c69c54d"},"outputs":[{"ename":"KeyboardInterrupt","evalue":"","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mKeyboardInterrupt\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipython-input-3621561253.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m\u003ccell line: 0\u003e\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     10\u001b[0m         \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mi\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mrange\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnneighbors\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     11\u001b[0m             \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mj\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mrange\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mi\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m+\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnneighbors\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---\u003e 12\u001b[0;31m                 \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0mneighbors\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0mj\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mppi_adj_forest\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0mneighbors\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0mi\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     13\u001b[0m                     \u001b[0mnctr\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m+=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     14\u001b[0m         \u001b[0mcivals\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0mn\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnctr\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m/\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnneighbors\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m*\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnneighbors\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m/\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mKeyboardInterrupt\u001b[0m: "]}],"source":["N = len(ppi_adj_list)\n","civals = numpy.zeros(100)\n","civals[:] = numpy.nan\n","start_time = timeit.default_timer()\n","for n in range(0, 100):\n","    neighbors = ppi_adj_list[n]\n","    nneighbors = len(neighbors)\n","    if nneighbors \u003e 1:\n","        nctr = 0\n","        for i in range(0, nneighbors):\n","            for j in range(i + 1, nneighbors):\n","                if neighbors[j] in ppi_adj_forest[neighbors[i]]:\n","                    nctr += 1\n","        civals[n] = nctr/(nneighbors*(nneighbors-1)/2)\n","\n","ci_elapsed = timeit.default_timer() - start_time\n","print(\"%0.2f s\" % ci_elapsed)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Cw8RuTge8-AG"},"source":["Step 7: Calculate the local clustering coefficients for the first 100 vertices using\n","the method `igraph.Graph.transitivity_local_undirected` and save the results as a list `civals_igraph`.
